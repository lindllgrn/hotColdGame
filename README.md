<h1>The Hot/Cold Game</h1>
<p>This code is made using pygame.</p>
<p>Created given a turtle code and then remade to be in pygame.</p>
<h2>What it does and how it works:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The user tries to find a hidden circle by using a circle of their own</li>
  <li>The game opens with a menu for the user to choose their difficulty and if they want to play or quit</li>
  <li>Depending on the difficulty chosen, determines the smaller the circle to find<\li>
  <li>Depending on the color of the user's circle, it will determine how close they are to the hidden circle</li>
  <li>If the circle is red, the user is moving closer towards the hidden circle</li>
  <li>If the circle is blue, the user is moving farther away from the hidden circle</li>
  <li>If the user finds the hidden circle, the hidden circle will turn yellow and the user's circle will turn green</li>
  <li>If the user finds the hidden circle under a certain amount of moves, the user will automatically go to the next level without having to go to the menu</li>
  <li>If they don't find it in under that number, the level will keep replaying until they do</li>
  <li>The user can also press 'd' to debug the game and change the color of the hidden circle so it is visible</li>
</ul>
<p><h3>Play to the end of the game to get a surprise :)</h3></p>
