<h1>The Hot/Cold Game</h1>
<p>This code is made using pygame.</p>
<p>Created given a turtle code and then remade to be in pygame.</p>
<li><h2>What it does and how it works:</h2></li>
  <ul>The user tries to find a hidden circle by using a circle of their own</ul>
  <ul>The game opens with a menu for the user to choose their difficulty and if they want to play or quit</ul>
  <ul>Depending on the difficulty chosen, determines the smaller the circle to find<\ul>
  <ul>Depending on the color of the user's circle, it will determine how close they are to the hidden circle</ul>
  <ul>If the circle is red, the user is moving closer towards the hidden circle</ul>
  <ul>If the circle is blue, the user is moving farther away from the hidden circle</ul>
  <ul>If the user finds the hidden circle, the hidden circle will turn yellow and the user's circle will turn green</ul>
  <ul>Once the user finds the circle, they can press 'r' to reset the game and move the hidden circle to a different spot</ul>
  <ul>The user can also press 'd' to debug the game and change the color of the hidden circle so it is visible</ul>
